# Task-02: Simple Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation

## Description
This tool implements image encryption using pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel of an image. Encryption involves transforming the pixel values of an image to hide its original content, and decryption reverses this process to retrieve the original image.

## How to Use
1. **Input**: Provide an image file (supported formats like JPEG, PNG, etc.).
2. **Operation**: Choose encryption or decryption.
3. **Key**: Provide the key

## Instructions
1. Provide the image file path.
2. Run the Python program `image_encryption_tool.py`.
3. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt an image.
4. Provide the key as a number that you won't forget

## Example
Suppose you have an image `example.png` that you want to encrypt:
- Input: `example.png`
- Operation: Encrypt
- Key: 4

To decrypt `example.png` back to the original image, use the decryption operation.
